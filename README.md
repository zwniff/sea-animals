# MarineDex

**MarineDex** is built on a sophisticated classifier that utilizes a pretrained transfer learning model known as MobileNetV2. This advanced model is designed specifically for the classification of marine organisms, allowing it to efficiently analyze and identify various species from user-provided images. By leveraging the power of deep learning, MobileNetV2 enhances the accuracy of species identification, making it an essential tool in understanding marine biodiversity.

MarineDex is an innovative application dedicated to the classification and monitoring of marine biodiversity in Indonesia. Its primary goal is to contribute to the conservation of marine life by providing real-time data on endangered species and facilitating informed decision-making for conservation policies. The application not only classifies marine organisms but also offers basic information about the detected species, promoting awareness and education among users. By fostering a user-friendly platform for identifying and learning about marine species, MarineDex plays a crucial role in supporting biodiversity monitoring and environmental conservation initiatives. This innovative approach aligns with current environmental challenges, positioning MarineDex as a strong contender in the ACTION 2024 competition at Unesa.
